# reactclicker

A cookie clicker clone based in ReactJS, as a sort-of motivation to learn ReactJS. Build with:

* npm
* ReactJS
* SASS
* Github Pages

[Demo](http://palomoduarte.com/reactclicker/)

## How to use it

`npm install` to install all the dependencies

`npm run build` to generate all the assets in public/build folder

`npm run watch` to generate assets but also watch for file changes

Remember that you can also start a very simple HTTP server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

## TODO List

- [ ] Set up jenkins as a build pipeline to run tests
  - [ ] Add testing infrastructure
- [ ] Styling:
  - [ ] Basic styling
- [ ] Add Flow as design pattern for component communication
- [x] Configure NPM to build assets (JSX and SASS)
- [ ] Game logic
  - [ ] Add silly messages ðŸ˜…
  - [ ] Refactor power ups management
